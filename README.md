📊 Overview
This system allows:

📦 Management of UAV components: Wings, Fuselages, Tails, and Avionics.
🛠️ Assembly of UAVs from available components.
📊 Detailed insights and availability status for each component.
🔒 Role-based access control to manage permissions effectively.
The project supports both development and production environments with Docker Compose for easy deployment.

💻 Tech Stack
Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
Database: PostgreSQL
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
🛠️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ecegozutok/UAV.git
cd UAV/website
2. Build and Run Docker Containers
docker-compose up --build
This will:

Create and run PostgreSQL and Django containers.
Apply database migrations.
Collect static files.
3. Access the Application
Open your browser and navigate to:
👉 http://localhost:8000

⚙️ Database Configuration
The database settings are pre-configured in settings.py:

DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        "NAME": "uavdb",
        "USER": "uavuser",
        "PASSWORD": "uavpassword",
        "HOST": "db",
        "PORT": "5432",
    }
}
Database Name: uavdb
Username: uavuser
Password: uavpassword
Host: db (Docker service name)
Port: 5432
Make sure these match your docker-compose.yml file.

🚀 Usage
1. Access Django Admin
URL: http://localhost:8000/admin
Default credentials: (create a superuser if needed)
docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
2. API Endpoints
/api/wing_counts/: Check wing availability.
/api/fuselage_counts/: Check fuselage availability.
/api/tail_counts/: Check tail availability.
/api/avionics_counts/: Check avionics availability.
3. Stop the Containers
docker-compose down
📦 Static Files
Static files are collected in the /staticfiles directory inside the container:

Static Root: /app/staticfiles
In production, ensure a web server like Nginx serves these static files efficiently.

🚀 Deployment
1. Build the Docker Image
docker-compose build
2. Run Containers in Detached Mode
docker-compose up -d
3. Access Application
Open:
👉 http://localhost:8000
